# Goals

Citizen Gen is a relatively simple service, but still regardless, I have ambitions for it beyond just a simple utility.


- [ ] Improve caching to use something like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Platform Storage Buckets vs just caching files locally to disk
- [ ] Add statistics 
- [x] Improve profile picture generation to add a dynamic crop (in progress)
- [ ] Badges & profiles (social experiment)
